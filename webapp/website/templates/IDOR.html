    <h5>
        What is IDOR?
    </h5>
    <p>
        IDOR stands for (Insecure Direct Object Reference). 
        It is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input, without proper authorisation checks. 
        This allows attackers to access or modify data they are not supposed to have access to by manipulating the input.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>
        How Does IDOR Work?
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Direct Access: The application uses identifiers (such as user IDs, file names, or database keys) provided by the user to directly access objects.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Lack of Authorisation Checks: The application does not properly verify if the user has permission to access the object.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Manipulated Input: An attacker changes the identifier in their request to access a different object.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Unauthorised Access: The application retrieves or modifies the object based on the manipulated identifier, allowing unauthorised access.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="content">
<h5>
    Dangers of IDOR Vulnerability
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        Data Breach: Attackers can access sensitive information, leading to privacy violations.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Data Manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data they do not own.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Unauthorised Actions: Attackers can perform actions on behalf of other users, 
        such as approving transactions or modifying settings.
    </li>
    <br>
</ul>
<p> In this example today you will manually test for an IDOR vulnerability by manipulating the parameters of the URL on the notes
    page, (then underneath a picture of the notes page)
</p>
<p>
    For this to work you will have to make sure there are atleast 2 notes within the database saved, one note owned by one account and one note
    belonging to another account this may be already done, but if not dont worry just create 2 seperate accounts using the signup page and create 1
    or more notes on each. (maybe add signup page pic)
</p>
<p>
    Now after that is confirmed and the parameters are set navigate to the notes page. now the note displayed will correspond to one
    of the notes your current user account has created. from there you may notice the url looks a little bit like how we explained
    earlier that an example of the IDOR vulnerability (pic of note page)
</p>
<p>
    Now on this page you can clearly see that the note details are displayed with the id of your note, content, date and User ID that
    corresponds to the user who created that note.
</p>
<p>
    From here you are going to select the url bar at the top and change the example: /view-note/1 to /view-note/2 or similar then hit enter
    and it should display a different note that corresponds to note ID 2 and if done corrrectly that note should have a different User ID
    maybe of 2 or 3 etc. This means that as User ID: 1 you are now seeing a note created by User ID:2 without any validation and no barriers
    blocking your user from reading their sensitive information stored in their account. (pic of User ID:2 note)
</p>
<p>
    As you may notice in a real-world application this type of vulnearbility is highly sensitive and can be catastrophic if used in specific
    ways.

<div class="content">
    <h5>Level 1: Unauthorised Note Access (No User Check)</h5>
    <p>
      In this level, the application directly retrieves a note from the database using the <code>note_id</code> from the URL, but does <b>not</b> check whether the current user owns that note.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone can access <code>/view-note/1</code>, <code>/view-note/2</code>, etc., regardless of who created the note.</li>
      <li>This allows users to read (and potentially modify) notes belonging to other accounts.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><b>Exploitation Steps:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in to any user account.</li>
      <li>Create a note using the notes interface.</li>
      <li>Visit <code>/view-note/1</code> (or another ID that doesn't belong to you).</li>
      <li>If successful, you will see someone else’s note content.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p><b>Route:</b> <code>/view-note/&lt;int:note_id&gt;</code> — no ownership check.</p>
  </div>
  

  <div class="content">
    <h5>Level 2: Login Required, But Ownership Check Is Misleading</h5>
  <p>
  This level adds a login requirement using <code>@login_required</code>, but implements a flawed or misleading ownership check.
  Instead of verifying whether the note belongs to the currently logged-in user, the code checks a condition that always passes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users must be logged in — so anonymous access is blocked.</li>
    <li>However, any authenticated user can access other users’ notes due to weak validation logic.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Exploitation Steps:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create two accounts (e.g., user A and user B).</li>
    <li>Log in as user A and try visiting <code>/view-note2/2</code>.</li>
    <li>If note 2 belongs to user B, it will still be accessible due to the flawed check.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Route:</b> <code>/view-note2/&lt;int:note_id&gt;</code> — login is enforced, but access control logic is broken.</p>
  </div>
  

  <div class="content">
    <h5>Level 3: Partial Ownership Check (Bypassable)</h5>
  <p>
  This level introduces a conditional check that allows access to a note if either:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The note belongs to the current user, <strong>or</strong></li>
    <li>The <code>note_id</code> is an <strong>odd number</strong> (e.g., 1, 3, 5...)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  This is a deliberately flawed and inconsistent ownership check. An attacker can still access unauthorized notes just by guessing odd-numbered IDs, even if they do not own them.
  </p>

  <p><b>Exploitation Steps:</b></p>
  <ol>
     <li>Log in as user A and create a note (note its ID, e.g., 2).</li>
     <li>Log in as user B and try accessing <code>/view-note3/2</code> — it will be denied.</li>
     <li>Then try <code>/view-note3/1</code> or <code>/view-note3/3</code> — if those notes exist and are odd-numbered, you will be able to access them regardless of ownership.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Route:</b> <code>/view-note3/&lt;int:note_id&gt;</code> — contains partial access control, but it's flawed and easily bypassed.</p>
  </div>

    <h5>How to Identify IDOR Vulnerabilities</h5>
    <p>
      IDORs are often discovered during manual testing of web applications. You can identify them by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Looking for URLs that contain numeric IDs (e.g., <code>/view/123</code>, <code>/download?file=invoice7.pdf</code>)</li>
      <li>Changing these IDs to guess other valid resources (e.g., <code>/view/124</code>)</li>
      <li>Noticing if other users' data appears — this suggests missing ownership validation</li>
      <li>Testing both GET and POST requests (IDORs can exist on forms, actions, and APIs too)</li>
    </ul>
