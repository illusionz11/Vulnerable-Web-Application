    <h5>
        What is XSS?
    </h5>
    <p>
        The first exploit we are going to use is called XSS (cross site scripting). XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.
        These scripts can then execute in the end-users browser, commonly a browser-side script.
        Attacks such as this are common among websites and can be found anywhere in an application.
    </p>
    <p> 
        There are multiple types of XSS attacks. In this section, we will describe them and focus on one as part of the training on exploiting
        this attack.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <div class="row align-items-start">
      <div class="col">
        <h5 align="center">Stored XSS</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                This is where the injected script is reflected back off the web server, and can be displayed in such a way as an error
                message for example or a response to the meessage sent from the end user that could include the input sent to the server. 
            </p>
            <p>The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database, comment field, or forum post.</p> 
            <p>When other users access the affected page, the script runs in their browsers.</p>
            <p>Example: An attacker posts a comment containing a malicious script on a forum. Every time someone views that comment, the script executes.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5 align="center">Reflected XSS</h5>
        <br>
            <p>The malicious script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes user input.</p>
            <p>It is a one-time attack, where the user is tricked into clicking a link or submitting a form that contains the malicious code.</p>
            <p>Example: An attacker sends a victim a link to a website with a script embedded in the URL. When the victim clicks the link, the script runs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h5 align="center">DOM-Based XSS</h5>
        <br>
        <p>The vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than the server-side code.</p>
        <p>The script modifies the DOM (Document Object Model) of the webpage directly on the client side, without involving the server.</p>
        <p>Example: An attacker injects a script into a URL, and when the victim visits the URL, the script changes the webpage's DOM and executes malicious actions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Now the type of XSS attack demonstrated below and you will be interacting with is a Reflected XSS attack. So beforehand
            there will be a quick explanation on how a Reflected XSS attack works with a step by step instruction then you can test it for yourself.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>
            How Reflected XSS Works
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                User Input: The attacker identifies a form or URL parameter where they can inject malicious code.
                This could be a search box, a form field, or any URL parameter that gets reflected back in the server's response
            </li>
            <li>
                Malicious Script Injection: The attacker crafts a URL or form input that includes malicious JavaScript code.
                They then trick a victim into clicking the malicious link or submitting the form with the injected script.
            </li>
            <li>
                Script Execution: When the victim's browser processes the request, the server reflects the input back to the browser without proper sanitisation.
                The malicious script gets executed in the context of the victim's session with the website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Exploitation: The attacker can now execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as
                stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or defacing the website.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            So below there will be a HTML Form that is asking the user to enter (something) into the text box as we are looking to test
            this form to see if we can accomplish a successful XSS attack ther will be some specific commands we will inject this text box
            with.
        </p>
        <p>
            FIrstly lets explain, the way this testing will be done is a manual test meaning no external or commerical tools outside of this machine will be required 
            in this purpose, and the method used is called manual fuzzing. this is where you will input multiple payloads manually into the 
            form and measure the response and handling of these paylaods by the web server.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore you will be using the payload '<code>&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS Level 1')&lt;/script&gt;</code>' to test this. So copy the given script then enter it into the text box and click submit.
        </p>        
        <p>
            If the payload was successful the web server should have responsded with an alert message at the top of your display saying
            (IP):(Port) says XSS!. If this is true then you have successfully exploited a Reflected XSS vulnearbility.
