    <h5>
        What is SQL Injection?
    </h5>
    <p>
        SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of security vulnerability in web applications where an attacker can manipulate the SQL queries that the application sends to its database. 
        This allows the attacker to interfere with the application's database queries, potentially leading to unauthorised data access, data modification, or even complete database compromise.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>
        How Does SQL Injection Work?
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            User Input: Web applications often accept user input to interact with the database, such as login forms, search boxes, or URL parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Manipulated Input: An attacker provides specially crafted input that includes SQL code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unsanitised Input: If the application fails to properly sanitise and validate this input, the malicious SQL code gets executed as part of the database query.
        </li>
        <li>
            Execution: The database executes the manipulated query, which can lead to unintended actions such as data leakage, data modification, or even full control of the database.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>
        Types of SQL Injection
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Classic SQL Injection:
            Directly manipulating SQL queries by injecting malicious input.</li>
        <li>Blind SQL Injection:
            The attacker receives no direct feedback about the structure of the query,
            but can infer information based on the application's behavior.</li>
        <li>Error-Based SQL Injection:
            The attacker can cause SQL errors that reveal details about the database structure.</li>
        <li>Union-Based SQL Injection:
            Using the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result,
            thus retrieving data from different tables.</li>
        <li>Second Order SQL Injection:
            Malicious input is stored in the database and executed as part of another query at a later time.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now for this vulnerability we are going to be utilising the insecure login Pages as we will be using SQL injection to gain access
        to a user account without using the password. prerequisites - Verified Account. This can be done by either creating an
        account or verifying a user already exists within the SQL database
    </p>
    <p>
        From there navigate to the logout page and then to the login_insecure pages.
    </p>
        <h5>Why Is SQL Injection Dangerous?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Bypasses authentication checks to gain unauthorised access</li>
          <li>Allows attackers to read, write, delete, or modify data</li>
          <li>Enables complete database takeover in advanced scenarios</li>
          <li>May lead to server-side file writes, OS-level command execution, or pivoting into internal networks</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h5>How Attackers Exploit SQL Injection</h5>
        <p>Attackers typically exploit SQLi by injecting payloads into input fields such as login forms or search bars. These payloads modify the SQL query sent to the database.</p>
        <p>For example, in a vulnerable login form:</p>
        <pre><code>
        Input:
          Username: admin' --
          Password: anything
      
        Resulting Query:
          SELECT * FROM User WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything'
        </code></pre>
        <p>The <code>--</code> comments out the rest of the query, bypassing the password check.</p>
</div>
      <!-- LEVEL 1 -->
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Level 1: SQLi via Wildcard Matching (LIKE Wildcard Injection)</h5>
        <p>
          In this login form, the username and password inputs are injected directly into a SQL query using <code>LIKE</code> instead of <code>=</code>, which makes matching easier and allows attackers to use <code>%</code> wildcards.
        </p>
        <p><b>Example Exploit:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <code>/login_insecure</code></li>
          <li>Enter the following credentials:<br>
            Username: <code>%</code><br>
            Password: <code>%</code>
          </li>
          <li>This will match any record in the User table and log you in as the first user.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Why It's Vulnerable:</b> No input sanitisation, and the use of <code>LIKE</code> makes exploitation even easier.</p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- LEVEL 2 -->
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Level 2: Classic SQLi with Exact Match Injection</h5>
        <p>
          This version uses <code>=</code> instead of <code>LIKE</code>, which means you need a more targeted injection. However, it still directly injects user input into the SQL query with no sanitisation.
        </p>
        <p><b>Example Exploit:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <code>/login_insecure2</code></li>
          <li>Enter the following credentials:<br>
            Username: <code>admin' --</code><br>
            Password: <code>anything</code>
          </li>
          <li>The query becomes:<br>
            <code>SELECT * FROM User WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything'</code><br>
            The password check is commented out, allowing login.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Why It's Vulnerable:</b> The input is still unsanitised, allowing classic inline comment-style injection.</p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- LEVEL 3 -->
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Level 3: Superficial Filtering Only Weak Sanitization</h5>
        <p>
          In this version, the application attempts to block SQL injection by removing <code>--</code> from the input. However, this is easily bypassed using alternative injection techniques.
        </p>
        <p><b>Example Exploit:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <code>/login_insecure3</code></li>
          <li>Enter the following credentials:<br>
            Username: <code>anything</code><br>
            Password: <code>' OR '1'='1</code>
            
          </li>
          <li>The query becomes:<br>
            <code>SELECT * FROM User WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'anything'</code><br>
            Since <code>'1'='1'</code> is always true, the login succeeds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Why It's Vulnerable:</b> Stripping <code>--</code> is not enough. Other SQLi payloads still work, as input isn't parameterised.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Identifying SQL Injection Vulnerabilities</h5>
        <p>Common signs of SQLi include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Application behaviour changes with unscoped inputs <code>%</code></li>
          <li>Login works with incorrect passwords and injections like <code>' OR '1'='1</code></li>
          <li>Database errors appear after entering special characters (like <code>'</code>, <code>--</code>, or <code>;</code>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Security testers often use SQLi payload lists and fuzzing tools like <b>sqlmap</b> to automate discovery.</p>
